# poipoi

A small Clojure library for parsing raw osm.pbf (protocolbuffer binary format) files into Clojure data structures

## Usage

```clojure
   [poipoi "0.1.0"]

;; In your require statement:
   [poipoi.core :refer [datafy-osm-pbf]]

;; Datafy osm pbf
   (datafy-osm-pbf input-stream)

;; Where `input-stream` is an instance of `java.io.InputStream` representing the osm.pbf file. 
;; Note that the evaluation of the datafy-osm-pbf function is lazy.
```
## Osm pbf files
The raw pbf files this library is intended parse are located at
`download.geofabrik.de` i.e. https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/rhode-island-latest.osm.pbf
